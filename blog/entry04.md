For this assignment, I had to investigate a web framework that will ease up the development of Virtual Reality experience, directly in the browser, so I picked A-Frame. The thing that attracted me to A-Frame was the promise of simplicity and never having to leave the world of the web, of using technologies I already know like HTML.

Why A-Frame? SASS and jQuery were other options, but the relative ease of creating 3D environments with a few lines of HTML is an opportunity not often matched. The functionality of cross-device, cross-platform compatibility, and more links to a vested virtual community sold me entirely to stick with A-Frame. And the capacity for rapid prototyping that would take less time to accomplish for my immediate needs at this time rendered A-Frame the possibility.
What I Tinked With/Where I Started From.

I essentially tinkered from an A-frame example that just had a scene with a box, sphere, and cylinder. I went from there as I was experimenting with different attributes/components.

Geometric Shapes: I created additional cones and toruses in the render. I changed their position along with the rotation, radius, and height settings to see what they would do.

Applied Color/Materials: I rendered new color settings to see how they looked/rendered with the lighting of the scene. I attempted to access the material settings in different ways to change them.

Lighting: I created a point light and changed its positioning and scale/color settings to see how much more shadow/light it created. I rendered a torus knot and adjusted the p and q settings.

Sky and Ground: I changed the sky color for different effects, and I added a plane for the ground so it had a bit more depth and perspective. - Visual Inspector: I looked at the visual inspector (<ctrl> + <alt> + i) and the console to see what was rendered in scenes and for debugging, which helped me understand hierarchy and rendering.


## Reflection & Sources
The only challenge aside from the ease of use from A-Frame stemmed from the entity-component structure as it was a new phenomenon figuring out how to piece together my scene this way. Yet there's enough documentation and such a huge community to render problem solving for any issues quite easy.

A-Frame official website: https://aframe.io/

MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML - A great source of web development information along with complete HTML documentation.

W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - Easy to understand tutorials and examples for the absolute beginner

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/ - this website you provided us to better learning Html and css, but solving challenges on our own.


Takeaways:

Developer mindset working with code.

Testing out various property/component changes to see reactions.

Incremental adjustments to gauge effects.

New inspiration learned through A-Frame documentation.


## Skills Acquired ;
Web development HTML/Javascript skills to create an interactive experience.

Basic understanding of 3D modeling, lighting, and material properties.

Critical thinking from understanding how to troubleshoot and learning the best practices of experimentation.

With the sources added within this write-up, it up further my skills and knowledge about Html, the website that really helped me with this task was W3Schools, as i can learn a specfic code, plus,  the website allows me to try it myself so i can get a better understanding of it.

Before, I've always had a very professional attitude—from addressing my process to clean documentation and annotated code to crediting research when due. I've always been a keen learner and loved to "play" with any new technology.


## EDP

Optimization: A-Frame's performance focus aligns with the optimization stage of the EDP. I aimed to create a scene that ran smoothly without sacrificing visual quality.

Documentation: Creating clear and concise documentation (like this write-up ) is an essential part of the EDP. It helps others understand and replicate work
