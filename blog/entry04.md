# Entry 4: A-frame

For this assignment, I had to investigate a web framework that will ease up the development of Virtual Reality experience, directly in the browser, so I picked A-Frame. The thing that attracted me to A-Frame was the promise of simplicity and never having to leave the world of the web, of using technologies I already know like HTML.

Why A-Frame? SASS and jQuery were other options, but the relative ease of creating 3D environments with a few lines of HTML is an opportunity not often matched. The functionality of cross-device, cross-platform compatibility, and more links to a vested virtual community sold me entirely to stick with A-Frame. And the capacity for rapid prototyping that would take less time to accomplish for my immediate needs at this time rendered A-Frame the possibility.

## Reflection & Sources
The only challenge aside from the ease of use from A-Frame stemmed from the entity-component structure as it was a new phenomenon figuring out how to piece together my scene this way. Yet there's enough documentation and such a huge community to render problem solving for any issues quite easy.

Takeaways:
  Participation:

Developer mindset working with code.

Testing out various property/component changes to see reactions.

Incremental adjustments to gauge effects.

New inspiration learned through A-Frame documentation.


## Skills Acquired ;
Web development HTML/Javascript skills to create an interactive experience.

Basic understanding of 3D modeling, lighting, and material properties.

Critical thinking from understanding how to troubleshoot and learning the best practices of experimentation.

Before, I've always had a very professional attitude—from addressing my process to clean documentation and annotated code to crediting research when due. I've always been a keen learner and loved to "play" with any new technology.
