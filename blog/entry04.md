# presented by Aaron Williams

### Contents 
I have explored A-Frame. A-Frame is a web framework for building VR experiences which is very unique and cool in all sorts. I tinkered by altering the shape properties, adding new elements, and experimenting with colors, lighting, etc. It was little to no troubles with working with Aframe, which led to my ultimate decision to stick with A-frame as it been a smooth journey so far, as A-Frame's simplicity is ideal for the rapid prototyping that i'll be going through.
