## Process Writeup
## Name: Aaron Williams
## Course: SEP10 Web Design
## Period: 7
## Concept: HTML elements
## Context
HyperText Markup Language is referred to as HTML. Similar to blueprints for a structure's outline, HTML serves as the blueprint for websites. the language model intructs your computer on how to set up your webpage. In order to full comprehend this potent tool, I required a guide. I've became proficient with HTML elements thanks to FreeCodeCamp's note taking. As i gained experiences, I was able to create simple webpages with the essebtial components.
* ## Headings
 * `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These tags are used to create heading to different sizes.

## Paragraphs
*`<p>`: This is use to create paragraph of text.
## Links
*`<a>`: used  this tag to create links to other pages or websites.
## Images
* `<img>`: Use this tag to create links to your page.
## A simple HTML Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple web page created using HTML.</p>
imple web page created using HTML.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```
## Opening this up the first time i was confused to say the least i had no clue what to do,  i searched everywhere on the internet to help me find answer, on how to do things, to make my webpage presentable. Then i found w3schools.com, This website helped me find and understand each element that can be in use for me and it gave me examples that io can use.
