## Introduction
## Currently I'm learning the basics of CSS. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet, is a language model that i use to style HTML elements. This allows me to control the appearance of web pages; this includes color, fonts,layouts, and etc.

## Experiences while Learning Css
## Overtime, I've been exploring the fundamentals of CSS, it's been amazing while also challenging journey. I've learned how to select elements using various selectors such as class,ID, and elements selectors. With these selectors, I can apply specific style to different 
parts of my web page.

## Challenges
## Something that I often struggle with is being unorganized, either in my personal life or working, when I'm in the zone. I don't think about the later, so often when I write my CSS, it's often unorganized, which later led me to be confused and made it hard for me to maintain order in my style sheet. My CSS lacks a clear structure as most of the class names are generic and don't provide any context what so ever. I've learned that I should use more descriptive names that help others understand. While also helping me maintain my style sheet. This right here is an example of how my CSS used to look like before. I have outside help to help me improve.
