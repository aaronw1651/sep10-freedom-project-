## My A-Frame Journey:
Over the past month, my exploration of A-Frame has been a hands-on journey into the creation of immersive 3D web experiences. This learning process has involved a structured approach, leveraging various resources and focusing on building practical skills.

## Content:

My primary focus has been on mastering the fundamentals of A-Frame, moving from introductory tutorials to more advanced techniques. I've actively tinkered with the code, applying my learning to the creation of several personal domains and mini-projects. The goal has been to gain a strong understanding of how to build 3D environments and manipulate elements within them from the ground up. This hands-on approach, documented in my learning log, showcases my active engagement with A-Frame and my progress towards creating project-relevant content.

## Sources:
Throughout this learning phase, online resources have been crucial. YouTube, in particular, has served as a significant source of tutorials and explanations, providing insights into A-Frame's capabilities and best practices for building environments and models. The specific videos that significantly contributed to my understanding include:

These resources provided diverse perspectives and practical demonstrations that accelerated my learning.

## Engineering Design Process: 
My learning journey has been guided by a planned approach, implemented both during and outside of class time. Before the break, I developed a structured plan to map out my coding and learning objectives specifically for utilizing A-Frame. This plan included:

Day 1: Focused on continued learning about 3D environments through both active tinkering with A-Frame and analyzing instructional videos to understand different techniques and applications.

Day 2: Aimed at incorporating the knowledge gained into my webpage about Media, initiating the coding process to apply newly acquired skills.

Day 3: Targeted achieving a comprehensive understanding of controlling 3D environments and effectively applying these skills to my project topic.

This proactive planning demonstrates a systematic approach to skill development, aligning with the principles of the engineering design process.

## Skills:
Acquiring Proficiency in A-Frame and 3D Web Development (Demonstrates the acquisition of new skills)
Through consistent engagement with A-Frame and the resources mentioned, I have actively developed skills in:

Understanding the A-Frame framework and its syntax.

Creating and manipulating 3D primitives and entities.

Designing and implementing basic 3D environments.

Integrating external assets and potentially more complex elements (as I continue to learn).
