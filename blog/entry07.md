# Entry 7
##### 6/15/25
It feels like just yesterday we were deep into our Freedom Projects, but so much has happened since then! The biggest news? My entire class has officially wrapped them up. We spent a good two to three weeks sharing and presenting our work to each other. And then, in the middle of our last week, came the main event: the expo. It was definitely nerve-wracking, but also a lot of fun. Suprisingly, i came first place, that's crazy right ? On Friday i presented my presentation, i was really really scared to the point i started shaking. When i got on the stage i forgot my whole script out of nervousness. But when the time came, i still did it. I also got an Owala, cool right.

Takeaways

Presenting my Freedom Project, both in class and at the expo, was a huge learning experience. Looking back, one of the biggest challenges I faced was my nerves. I'd imagine the audience, especially the judges, as these incredibly critical figures, ready to pick apart every little detail. This fear often led to me giggling or stumbling over my words, which only made me feel more flustered. What I realized, though, is that most of those anxieties were completely unfounded. The judges and my classmates were supportive, not scary. This experience really taught me to not overthink or create negative scenarios in my head about things that haven't happened and probably won't.

Another key takeaway, particularly from the class presentations, was the value of preparation. I initially thought I could just wing it, but relying too much on improvisation often left me grasping for words. I learned the importance of having a solid script or outline. It's not about memorizing every single word like a robot, but more about having a clear guide that keeps you on track. This foundation allows for natural conversation and even a bit of improvisation when you feel confident.

Ultimately, working on this project and then presenting it reinforced a truth Mr. Muller often shares: there's no such thing as a perfect website. Even after all the work, there's always something more you could do, some small improvement you could make. It's a feeling I think I'll always have, but it also pushes me to keep learning and refining my skills.
