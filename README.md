# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Media Production.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study AI in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
<ul>
<li>Accessibility for everyday users: Visi-Rec, with its built-in AI, would democratize high-quality video creation, making it accessible to a wider audience beyond professionals.</li>

<li>Streamlined Workflow: The integration of recording, editing, and AI assistance directly into a contact lens would significantly simplify the media production process, reducing the need for multiple devices and software.</li>

<li>Innovative Applications: Beyond media production, the AI in Visi-Rec could assist with various daily tasks (like grocery lists) and be applied in fields such as architecture and chemistry, showcasing its versatility.</li>

<li>Enhanced Storytelling: By making Hollywood-level visual effects and seamless editing readily available, users could create more immersive and captivating content.</li>
</ul>

##### CONS
<ul>
<li>Privacy Concerns: A device capable of constant recording and data collection raises significant privacy issues for both the user and those around them.</li>

<li>Ethical Implications of AI-edited content: The ease of creating highly realistic but potentially manipulated footage could lead to the spread of misinformation or deepfakes.</li>

<li>Technical Hurdles and Miniaturization: Developing a contact lens with advanced recording, processing, and AI capabilities, along with sufficient battery life, presents immense engineering challenges.</li>

<li>Health and Safety: Long-term use of electronic contact lenses could pose risks to eye health.</li>

<li>Cost and Accessibility: Initial costs for such advanced technology would likely be prohibitive for many, limiting its widespread adoption despite the stated goal of accessibility.</li>

<li>Dependence on Technology: Over-reliance on an AI for editing and daily tasks might diminish human creative skills and critical thinking.</li>
</ul>
