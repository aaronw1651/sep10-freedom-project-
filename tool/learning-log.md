Things you tried, progress you made, etc.

Tried-
Implemented Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts.
Experimented with various button styles and sizes.
Integrated cards for displaying content blocks.
Implemented components such as dropdown and Modal.

Progress-
Gained a better understanding of Bootstrap's utility classes for spacing, typography, and colors.
Successfully created basic responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes..
Improved consistency of web page design. Before i was struggling with the compent modal, but after few youtube videos about it, it helped me fix my code and complete my assignment. 

Ex;
```
<div class="card invincible-card mb-4">
                    <div class="card-header">
                      Omni-Man(Nolan Grayson)
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body text-center">
                        <img src="Omni-ussy.jpg" alt="Atom Eve" class="img-fluid character-image">
                        <p>Nolan Grayson, Mark's father.</p>
                        <button class="btn invincible-button" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#nolanModal">Learn More</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
```
  In this example is shown a Omni-man modal window(pop-up). I often had struggles with it not popping up at all.
